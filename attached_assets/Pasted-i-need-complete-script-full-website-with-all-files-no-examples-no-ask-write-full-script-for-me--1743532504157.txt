Export FMT & Social Mobilizers Sessions (today's or all-time as well as child screening but here no mauc).

Excel Formatting: Title should be bold and centered. Column headers formatted properly and centered fit in columns. Wide text (e.g., village names) should have wrapping enabled. 6.

Login Button. WhatsApp Contact Button (+923032939576) for support. this should only be on main page just Only authorized users (created by Super Admin) can log in. Super Admin can monitor all user activities. No public registration.

also do not make errors and see blow other features i want these should be fixed 1. in users rename my name from Super Admin to Asif Jamali remove other default users, masters, fmt and sm, in user add add 2 more input fields, Email And Phone Number but both should be optional 2. Blogs page should be visable/available for public too even not a user, in blogs, there are names Dr sarah imran and fatma, rename these to Asif Jamali also from these both blogs and from blow paraghraph write home/main page when someone (who is not a user must see about of this website) Track4Health is a web-based health record management system focusing on child screening, immunization, nutrition, and hygiene awareness sessions. This system allows efficient bulk data entry, structured Excel exports, and real-time user tracking. 3. User Designation for users cant be edited by users while data entry, only masters/devloper can edit this when they are adding entries. 4. in awareness session and child screening at add session button (bulk entry option is not available, i want Add Attendees can be used bulk as add/+ participatant, i mean if there are 10 entires, sm and fmt will be writting 10 times village name and uc name so make bulk entry for Add Attendees) and this add session box is not responsive, i mean not being scrolled see screenshoot im asking for multiply entries + this box or what is best and easy for users, do that thing 5. at User Management if a user is online add a url blow to track his location, a clickable link to open in google map to view his currunt location 6. developer can delete any user, master can delete only fmt/sm users and fmt/sm cant do any managment with website, only they can access home, blogs, child screening data entry, and awareness sessions 1. users cant logout, only master and developer can 2. check screenshoot and fix it as i marked things in Awareness Sessions, remove double entry for date, village name and uc name, remove add session and add a input box here for session number, blow add a + icon infront of add Attendees for bulk entries, eg if i have 10 entries in session 1(i will write village name,uc name 1 time not 10 times for all attendess, after writting first person details i will click on + icon, this 1st must go blow in pending(editable also can be removed) and above name father name age etc should back to defualt for next entry), at end i will click on save session, also if i wrote 9 names and 1 is just written not added to bulk, both written and bulk should be saved and add a checkbox blow with remarks box (Person belongs to same UC (defualt it should be checked if we uncheck a box should open to add his real address (cause meybe he is a guest))) 3. add adding images option for session, but it should be with address top area, and multiply images can be added and taken by camera 4. as/after Awareness Sessions fix do all fixes for child screening page too, which i requested in previous msg, its not responsive and child screening at add session button (bulk entry option is not available, i want Add Attendees can be used bulk as add/+ participatant, i mean if there are 10 entires, sm and fmt will be writting 10 times village name and uc name so make bulk entry for Add Attendees) and this add session box is not responsive, i mean not being scrolled see screenshoot im asking for multiply entries + this box or what is best and easy for users, do that thing same add image options and same as screenshoot i said

these both pages (Awareness Sessions and child screening) ui should be same, just there fields and inputs are defrent, just fix add session of child screening... as same as awareness sessions 1 i want Dynamic Sidebar Navigation or Hover Expandable Sidebar also logout button should be hidden for users, masters and developer can logout only 2 on dashboard do not show blog lists and do not show "Field Worker 1 Field Monitor" this user is not exists, show only active workers here make this page fully responsive instead of "Nutritional Status Distribution" it is for screening update it 3 add Home button above Dashboard in sidebar, if we are loggedin, dont show login box else let login too, write about for this website here, some details for this website home should be fully responsive for home blow paraghaph is also an idea Project Goal: Track4Health is a web-based health record management system focusing on child screening, immunization, nutrition, and hygiene awareness sessions. This system allows efficient bulk data entry, structured Excel exports, and real-time user tracking. 4. The theme color should change when clicked. I need two themes: Dark and Light. In Dark Mode, use random dark colors. In Light Mode, use random light colors. Text should always remain clear and readable, unaffected by background colors. On every page change or refresh, a new random color should be applied. Theme & Colors

Ensure random light and dark colors are applied on every refresh or page change.

Prevent text readability issues by ensuring text always contrasts well with the background.

System theme (default) should be 99% white, including borders for a clean look.

Charts & Data Views

Do not add a pie chart on the home page. Instead, use a line chart.

Ensure full-month details are displayed on both dashboard and home page, not just a monthly summary.

User Roles & Permissions

Remove the "Add Developer" option from the Users page.

Role-based restrictions:

Developer: Can add Masters.

Master: Can add SM and FMT.

SM & FMT: Cannot logout, add users, or edit users. They can only access:

Home, Blogs, Child Screening, and Awareness Sessions.

New Fields in Data Entry

In Awareness Session & Child Screening, add:
